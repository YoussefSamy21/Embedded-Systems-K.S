# CANoe Accelerator Pedal Simulation
Using Vector CANoe popular tool (demo version), this Project is about Simulating 2 ECUs using CAN Protocol, providing communication between an Accelerator Pedal and a Speedometer.

**ECU1**: Periodically checks if the accelerator pedal is pressed, then sends the status of the accelerator to ECU2.  

**ECU2**: Changes the speed according to the status of the accelerator pedal.

## Skills Acquired
- Writing CAPL script for each ECU.
- Creating a Database using CANdb to add my ECUs, Messages, Signals.
- Creating a simple GUI, allowing to interact with tha data on CAN Bus. 
- Getting Familiar with Vector CANoe popular tool.
